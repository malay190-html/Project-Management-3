        <h1>Affinity Diagram: Parking Problem</h1>
        <p>
            The affinity diagram below illustrates the major challenges and possible solutions related to parking issues 
            at the University of South Carolina. It organizes the problem into key categories, each representing a crucial aspect of the parking problem, 
            such as insufficient spaces, time management, visitor parking challenges, and potential opportunities for improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>Categories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Insufficient Parking Spaces:</strong> The current parking infrastructure cannot accommodate the growing number of vehicles on campus.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management Issues:</strong> Overcrowding and limited space lead to delays and frustration when finding parking spots.</li>
            <li><strong>Visitor Parking Challenges:</strong> Visitors often struggle to find parking due to the lack of designated visitor spots and unclear instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternatives and Opportunities:</strong> Encourages exploration of sustainable transportation options, such as shuttles, bike-sharing programs, and carpooling incentives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Possible Solution</h2>
        <p>
            One potential solution involves integrating infrastructure development with technology. A new multi-level parking garage 
            can significantly increase parking capacity, while a real-time parking availability system can streamline the process of finding available spaces. 
            This system could use sensors in parking spots and a mobile application to guide users directly to open spaces. 
            Additionally, promoting alternative transportation options such as shuttle services, bike rentals, and carpooling programs can further reduce demand for parking.
